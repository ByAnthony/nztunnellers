## Brief

The New Zealand Tunnellers Web App is dedicated to a special military unit who fought in France during the First World War (1914-1918): the New Zealand Tunnelling Company. This company was formed at a time where the British Army was struggling in their fights against the German miners beneath the no man's land. The Web App tells the original story of this special unit and shares the experience of its men.
