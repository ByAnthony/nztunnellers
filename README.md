## What is the project about?

[The New Zealand Tunnellers Web App](https://www.nztunnellers.com) is dedicated to a special military unit who fought in France during the First World War (1914-1918): the *New Zealand Tunnelling Company*.

This company was formed at a time where the British Army struggled in their fights against the German miners beneath the no man's land. The Web App tells the [original story](https://www.nztunnellers.com/#history) of this special unit and shares the [men's war experience](https://www.nztunnellers.com/tunnellers/).
